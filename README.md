Overview
Std-Binance is a Python standard-library-inspired wrapper I built for the Binance API, providing a clean, modular interface for cryptocurrency trading operations. It standardizes common tasks like fetching market data, placing orders (spot/futures), managing wallets, and executing strategies, while handling authentication, rate limits, and error recovery. This project demonstrates my skills in API abstraction, async programming, and financial data processingâ€”ideal for building scalable trading bots or analytics tools.
Disclaimer: Requires a Binance account and API keys. For educational use only; trading involves risks and is not financial advice. Respect Binance's terms and rate limits.
Features

Standardized API Calls: Simplified methods for spot/futures trading, e.g., client.get_ticker('BTCUSDT') or client.place_market_order('ETHUSDT', 'BUY', quantity=0.1).
Async Support: Non-blocking operations using asyncio for high-frequency trading.
Wallet & Account Management: Query balances, transfer funds, and track positions.
Market Data Tools: Real-time klines (candles), order books, and historical data fetching.
Error Handling: Built-in retries, rate limiting, and HMAC-SHA256 signature generation.
Extensible: Easy to add custom endpoints or integrate with strategies (e.g., from your RSIstrategy repo).

Tech Stack

Language: Python 3.10+
Key Libraries:

requests or aiohttp for HTTP requests.
hmac and hashlib (standard lib) for API signing.
pandas for data parsing and analysis.
python-binance (optional base for validation).


Minimal dependencies; emphasizes standard library where possible.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.10 or higher.
Binance API keys (spot/futures; create at binance.com).
Git for cloning.

Installation

Clone the repository:
bashgit clone https://github.com/abd0o0/std-binance.git
cd std-binance

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
bashpython -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables (create .env in the root):
textBINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
BINANCE_TESTNET=True  # Use testnet for safety


Usage

CLI Example (Fetch Ticker Data):
bashpython binance_cli.py ticker --symbol BTCUSDT
Outputs current price, volume, etc., as JSON.
Programmatic Use (in a Python script):
pythonfrom std_binance.client import BinanceClient
import asyncio

# Initialize client (loads from .env)
client = BinanceClient(testnet=True)

# Sync example: Get account balance
balance = client.get_account()
print(balance['balances'])  # List of assets with free/locked amounts

# Async example: Place a market order
async def place_order():
    order = await client.place_market_order(
        symbol='ETHUSDT',
        side='BUY',
        quantity=0.01
    )
    print(order)  # Order details: ID, status, fills

asyncio.run(place_order())

Advanced: Fetch Historical Klies:
pythonfrom std_binance.client import BinanceClient

client = BinanceClient()
klines = client.get_klines('BTCUSDT', interval='1h', limit=100)
df = client.parse_klines(klines)  # Returns Pandas DataFrame
print(df.head())  # OHLCV data


Run python binance_cli.py --help for all commands. Examples in /examples folder; full API docs in /docs.
