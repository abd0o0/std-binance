# buy if the asset fell by more than SD% by calculating the volatility (standard deviation) within the last 30min
# sell if asset rise by more than SD-5% or falls further by SD-5%
# Return of Assets= Net Income / Total Assets
# smaller ratio
# Return of Assets of today(checking how the asset performing over the interval)
# == (return of the day - return of yesterday)/return of yesterday
# == day/yesterday -1
# cumulative return = (1+ ROA)*(1+ROY)-1 to solve the product problem we use LOG of return
# after the sum we take the exp -1 and we get the same result
